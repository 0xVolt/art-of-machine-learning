# About this repository
## Rekindling a flame
This repository does two things. First, it gets me back into the groove of studying. God knows it's been ages since I've been motivated to. Second, it serves as a journal to analyse how I pick up programming concepts, so I can find better ways to learn. 

## The Objective
The idea is to revisit all of the topics in machine learning I studied back in the first half of my B.Tech and to work my way up to complex themes that I've not been exposed to yet. In doing so, I hope to have a firm grasp of every concept to the point where I could whip up code for any of them should I need to. 

In other words, **Mastery. No less.**

Funnily enough, I'm going to create notes of all the mathematics behind each of these concepts so I'm going to have to use LaTex notation exhaustively. Just one other thing to learn I guess...
