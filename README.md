# About this repository

## Rekindling a flame

This repository does two things. First, it gets me back into the groove of studying. God knows it's been ages since I've been motivated to. Second, it serves as a journal to analyse how I pick up programming concepts, so I can find better ways to learn. 

## The Objective

The idea is to revisit all of the topics in machine learning I studied back in the first half of my B.Tech and to work my way up to complex themes that I've not been exposed to yet. In doing so, I hope to have a firm grasp of every concept to the point where I could whip up code for any of them should I need to. 

In other words, **Mastery. No less.**
