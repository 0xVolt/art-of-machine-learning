# 0. Introduction
This section of the repository will contain an introduction to machine learning, the way I am documenting my study of it and a plan on covering concepts. This is going to give me an opportunity to revisit all of the math behind some of machine learning's most fundamental constructs.

Everything learnt on this journey to revisit machine learning concepts and study further, is from [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v) by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/@sentdex).

## What is machine learning?

Arthur Samuel talked about machine learning being the field of study where we give machines the ability to learn without explicitly programming them to do so. A great way to think about it is to imbue knowledge to a machine without programming that knowledge in the first place and sort of allowing the machine (model, more precisely) to figure it out through a minimisation of loss and/or iterative approach to improve accuracy.

A common misconception is that a large portion of machine learning or rather, it's application is hardcoded when that couldn't be further from the truth. Most of machine learning isn't hardcoded and it's about finding the best way for the machine (model) to learn with as little effort from the programmer.
