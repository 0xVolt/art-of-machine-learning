# 0. Introduction
This section of the repository will contain an introduction to machine learning, the way I am documenting my study of it and a plan on covering concepts. This is going to give me an opportunity to revisit all of the math behind some of machine learning's most fundamental constructs.

Everything learnt on this journey to revisit machine learning concepts and study further, is from [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v) by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/@sentdex).
